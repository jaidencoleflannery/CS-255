DriverPass is a web system that helps students prepare for their driving test. The client (DriverPass) wanted a cloud platform for learning materials, tests, and scheduling for driving lessons. The system also supports staff and administrators so they can manage users. reservations and reporting. It can be accessed on the web via a UI.
The design clearly outlines user roles: students, administrators and IT staff. It describes how each would interact with the system and it also detailed features like login, account recovery, and admin controls for lesson scheduling.
If I had to improve on part it would be the treatment of payment processing and reporting. We mentioned them but didn’t really dive into the technical side of their implementation. Adding specific systems and security measures with detailed reporting options would be good.
The user’s needs were interpreted by connecting the clients goals to reduce DMV failures and improve scheduling accuracy.
When designing software it always helps to begin with the end goal in mind that way you can work backwards and break it into pieces. Defining use cases and user roles; then requirements into features. Techniques are also really helpful, like use case modeling and class diagrams, and constant feedback from clients allow a design to evolve.
